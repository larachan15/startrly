**Overall** | Great job overall! I love the use of colors, especially tomato! The only thing, (which you already know about) is that when you make the browser window, smaller, some of the text overlaps. I'm not sure if you should change some of the pixels to ems or percentages instead so that it's not a fixed size. I'm very excited to see your personal website :)
